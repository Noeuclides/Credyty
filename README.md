### 1. Pythagorean Triplet:
This exercise is base on the Pythagoras theorem and trigonometric identities:

![Pythagoras Theorem](https://images.theconversation.com/files/182675/original/file-20170820-7959-9aaq6j.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip)

![Trigonometric Identities](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/926405-ids4246826883428030385.png)

So "a" and "b" was moved in function of "c" and the 'angle'.
And the hypotenuse "c" increase in an interval of 335 to 500. The lower interval was choose because
the condition a < b < c is mandatory in the triplets so c must be at least 335 to achive that.
The round function was used to get an "integer" (is float type but rounded to zero decimals.)
and the angle didn't start at 1 because with the rounded function b is always equal to c.

The code was made with python3 and in order to use trigonometric identities It was needed the math library.

```sh
$ python3 pythagoras.py
```
